# productcatalog service

## Dynamic catalog reloading / artificial delay

This service has a "dynamic catalog reloading" feature that is purposefully
not well implemented. The goal of this feature is to allow you to modify the
`products.json` file and have the changes be picked up without having to
restart the service.

However, this feature is bugged: the catalog is actually reloaded on each
request, introducing a noticeable delay in the frontend. This delay will also
show up in profiling tools: the `parseCatalog` function will take more than 80%
of the CPU time.

You can trigger this feature (and the delay) by sending a `USR1` signal and
remove it (if needed) by sending a `USR2` signal:

```shell
# Trigger bug
kubectl exec \
    $(kubectl get pods -l app=productcatalogservice -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
    -c server -- kill -USR1 1
# Remove bug
kubectl exec \
    $(kubectl get pods -l app=productcatalogservice -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
    -c server -- kill -USR2 1
```

## OpenTelemetry instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry SDK is initialized in `main` using the `initOtelTracing` function.
This function contains the boilerplate code required to initialize a `TraceProvider`.
This service receives gRPC requests, which are instrumented in the `run` function as part of the gRPC server creation.

This is the code that is used to instrument the gRPC server:
```go
	srv = grpc.NewServer(
		grpc.UnaryInterceptor(otelgrpc.UnaryServerInterceptor(otelgrpc.WithTracerProvider(otel.GetTracerProvider()))),
		grpc.StreamInterceptor(otelgrpc.StreamServerInterceptor(otelgrpc.WithTracerProvider(otel.GetTracerProvider()))),
	)
```
